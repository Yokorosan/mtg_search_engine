# mtg_search_engine

Little Search Engine made with react typescript and Sass, consuming the public API from scryfall to print a random commander card on screen. 
Together with the commander card it bring all the rulings associated with said card, and enables twoi buttons that guide the persona to sites like EDHREC and Archidekt, if there's no ruling or no card image it gives u the link to the oficial gatherer website.
It can too search for any kind of cards, using the API/database from scryfall, and return the rulings for said cards, and the buttons for the card on EDHREC for information where the said card is used.

It was made using 
React Toastify.
Axios
Sass
TypeScript
React-Icons.

Very Simple application to test and feel a little of how to use Sass together with the REACT.
